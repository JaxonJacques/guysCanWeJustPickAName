ReMind

ReMind is a project oriented towards helping the elderly and individuals affected by dementia grow their cognitive and behavioural abilities. The app is structured towards sending push notifications to the users in order to remind them to train in a specific way that encourages healthy actions which promote functionality in people who need the reminder to stay active.
